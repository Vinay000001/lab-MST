4. The task
You again live in your own branch, this time we will be doing a bit of juggling with branches, to show how lightweight branches are in git. Hint: git switch will make you switch from one branch to another.
1.	Use git branch to see the two branches that are relevant for this exercise
   $ git branch

2.	What branch are you on?
   I am on main branch

3.	Use git branch mybranch to create a new branch called mybranch
   $ git branch mybranch
4.	Use git branch again to see the new branch created.
   $ git branch![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/d9af6db5-dc95-4eed-ad6d-b7ba53618ef1)

5.	Use git switch mybranch to switch to your new branch.
   $ git checkout mybranch
6.	How does the output from git status change when you switch between the master and the new branch that you have created?
   $ git status

  	{on main branch}

  	{on mybranch}

7.	How does the workspace change when you change between the two branches?
   $ git checkout <branch_name> can be used to switch between branches
  	nothing done on feature branch will affect the master branch unless
  	$ git merge <branch name> is used to merge the changes.
8.	Make sure you are on your mybranch branch before you continue.
   $ git checkout mybranch
  	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/e32a6b28-a394-4a75-8a8f-7f9d7a171df7)

9.	Create a file called file1.txt with your name.
   $ touch file1.txt
  	$ vi file1.txt
  	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/95796f4c-30e4-4890-b030-5f9229b055ed)

  	$ cat file1.txt
  	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/796bb635-c8bd-4413-8e05-069a77e5d4c9)

10.	Add the file and commit with this change.
    $ git add file1.txt
    $ git commit -m "commited file1.txt"
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/12205e38-d5e4-4444-9245-bd5f50217546)

11.	Use git log --oneline --graph to see your branch pointing to the new commit.
    $ git log --oneline --graph
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/6acf278a-0a11-4613-b045-6b8f330124a9)

12.	Switch back to the branch called master.
    $ git checkout main
13.	Use git log --oneline --graph and notice how the commit you made on the mybranch branch is missing on the master branch.
    $ git log --oneline --graph
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/db8594c5-e4af-424b-932a-1cbe7b2e04a0)

14.	Make a new file called file2.txt and commit that file.
  	 $ git touch file2.txt
    $ git add file2.txt
    $ git commit -m "commited file2.txt"
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/fa800f76-7440-4170-8d98-6f2e473037d1)

15.	Use git log --oneline --graph --all to see your branch pointing to the new commit, and that the two branches now have different commits on them.
    $ git log --oneline --graph
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/e89424a4-620b-40d2-b0b7-3ed00bd22797)

16.	Switch to your branch mybranch.
    $ git checkout mybranch
17.	What happened to your working directory? Can you see your file2.txt?
    $ pwd
    $ ls
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/195c5223-05bf-4264-aeaf-f460422b36c2)

18.	Use git diff mybranch master to see the difference between the two branches.
    $ git diff mybranch master
   	![image](https://github.com/Vinay000001/lab-MST/assets/156875473/f9ded3d4-85c8-41b2-a925-2d7567fc5deb)
